# Machine-Learning-Appliance-Prediction
University Kaggle competition using regression to predict household applaince consumption.
I built a prediction model using data from various sensors at different locations in the house and outside the house such as the local airport, room temperatures, humidity levels, and how much electricity gets used. The data is ordered in time, making it time-series data. Meaning we can see patterns in how energy is used over time. The project covers everything from looking at the data and extracting meaningful features or ideas, creating graphs, cleaning up, picking out important features, to training and testing the model.
